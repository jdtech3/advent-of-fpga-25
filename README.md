# Advent of FPGA '25

## Background

Contains my submission to [Jane Street's Advent of FPGA 2025](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/). I aim to write everything in OCaml + Hardcaml.

I have experience working with FPGAs (currently working in FPGA Architecture) and Verilog, but never touched OCaml let alone Hardcaml. Thus, this probably contains some questionable OCaml code, and I may not get past day 1, but we shall see!

## Setup

I use a self-hosted [Coder](https://coder.com/) deployment (essentially GitHub Codespaces but at home), see `infra/` for the OCaml + Hardcaml template I made. It is just a Terraform config + Dockerfile, so you may find it useful.

## Organization

I've kept to the Hardcaml template structure inside each solution folder, and see `README`s inside for further explanation.
